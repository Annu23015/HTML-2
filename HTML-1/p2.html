        <p>Python has become one of the most popular languages.
            So getting only the theoretical knowledge will be of no use unless and until you don’t work on some real-time
            projects. Working on such projects will test your Python knowledge and you will get some hands-on experience.
            Moreover, working on such projects will help you improve your knowledge. </p>
        <p>This article aimed at covering Python project ideas from beginners level to advance level under each domain 
        such as projects on GUI, projects on web development or projects involving the real-time face, vehicle, gun,
         sentiment detection, and even the projects involving some automation or voice assistant and many more exciting
          projects are also included.</p>
