        <h1>👩‍💻C++ Language:👩‍💻</h1>
        <p>C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs.
        C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ 
        tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded
        software engineers.

                    <li>C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.</li>

                        C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. 
                        I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in
                        terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming.
                        You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and
                        virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.

        <h1><u>Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</u></h1>
        <p>C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object-oriented programming (OOPs) used in C++ are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
