        <p>C programming language is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer 
        specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages
        of learning C Programming:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to learn</li>
            <li> Structured language</li>
            <li>It produces efficient programs</li>
            <li>It can handle low-level activities</li>
            <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p>C language Tutorial with programming approach for beginners and professionals, helps you to understand the C
             language tutorial easily. Our C tutorial explains each topic with programs.<br />
             The C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that 
            directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.</p>
        <b>It can be defined by the following ways:</b>  
        <ol>    
            <li>Mother language</li>
            <li>System programming language</li>
            <li>Procedure-oriented programming language</li>
            <li>Structured programming language</li>
            <li>Mid-level programming language</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>1) C as a mother language:</h3> 
        <p>C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because <b>most of 
           the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language,</b> and most of the programming languages follow C
           syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.</p> 
        <hr>   
        <h3>2) C as a system programming language:</h3>  
        <p>A system programming language is used to create system software.
            C language is a system programming language because it <b>can be used to do low-level programming 
            (for example driver and kernel).</b> It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc.
            For example, Linux kernel is written in C.</p>  
        <hr> 
        <h3>3) C as a procedural language</h3> 
        <p>A procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. A procedural language<b> specifies a series
           of steps for the program to solve the problem.</b></p>

        <h2>Applications of C Programming</h2>
        <div>
           <p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system.
            C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code
            written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are -</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating Systems</li>
                <li>Language Compilers</li>
                <li> Assemblers</li>
                <li>Text Editors</li>
                <li>Print Spoolers</li>
                <li>Network Drivers</li>
                <li>Modern Programs</li>
                <li>Databases</li>
                <li>Language Interpreters</li>
                <li>Utilities</li>
            </ul>
